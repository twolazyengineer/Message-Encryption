## Introduction

Message-Encryption is a Python project that allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages. This project demonstrates the use of basic encryption algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of messages.

## Features

- **Simple Encryption Algorithm:** Uses a basic algorithm for educational purposes.
- **Encrypt and Decrypt Messages:** Easily encrypt messages and later decrypt them with the correct key.
- **Command Line Interface:** Interact with the program using the command line.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Message-Encryption.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Message-Encryption
   ```
3. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the encryption script:
   ```bash
   python encrypt.py "Your message here" "yourkey"
   ```
   This will output the encrypted message.

2. Run the decryption script:
   ```bash
   python decrypt.py "Encrypted message here" "yourkey"
   ```
   This will output the original message.
